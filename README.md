# World-Dataset-With-MYSQL
This was a SQL analyzed project with Mysql's sample dataset - "World". The dataset consisted of three tables about factors influencing countries' life expectancy and GNP.


## Source Code and Finding

#### 1. ranking countries by GNP and GNPOLD
select rank() over (order by gnp desc) as gnp_rank, rank() over (order by gnpold desc) as gnp_old_rank, name, gnp, gnpold, lifeexpectancy from country order by gnp_rank;
###### 	Finding:
	- Top 10 GNP countries remained stable in ranking.
	- Despite able to maintain in the its ranking, Japan had suffered 9.67% drop, Brazil had 3.4% drop, and Canada had 4.28% drop.


#### 2. oldest life expectancy in the world
select co.name, co.continent, co.surfacearea, co.population, max(co.lifeexpectancy) as Max_lifeexpectancy, co.gnp, cl.language, cl.*, ci.*
from country as co
inner join countrylanguage as cl
on co.code = cl.countrycode
inner join city as ci
on cl.countrycode = ci.countrycode;
###### Finding:
	- Aruba was the country with highest life expectancy at 83.5 years old. The country was an island with surface area at 193 mi2, and populations at 103,000.
	- Dutch was the official language spoken by 53% of local people. The capital was Oranjestad and had 29,034 people. 

#### 3. find top life expectancy countries by continents, ranking by world's life expectancy
create view v_continent_rank as 
		select code, name, continent, region,  
			lifeexpectancy, rank() over (partition by continent order by lifeexpectancy desc) as life_con_rank, rank() over (order by lifeexpectancy desc) as life_rank, min(lifeexpectancy) over (partition by continent) as lowest_con_life,
			gnp, rank() over (partition by continent order by gnp desc) as gnp_con_rank, rank() over (order by gnp desc) as gnp_rank
		from country 
		order by continent, lifeexpectancy;

select * from v_continent_rank where lifeexpectancy is not null and life_con_rank =1 order by lifeexpectancy desc;
###### Finding:
The top life expectancy per continent: 
1. Andorra(Europe)
2. Macao(Asia)
3. Australia(Oceania)
4. Canada(North America)
5. Saint Helena(Africa)
6. and French Guiana(South America)

#### 4. find top GNP countries by continents, ranking by world's GNP
select * from v_continent_rank where gnp >0 and gnp_con_rank =1 order by gnp desc;
###### 	Finding:
The top GNP countries per continent: 
1. USA(North America)
2. Japan(Asia)
3. Germany(Europe)
4. Brazil(South America)
5. Australia(Oceania)
6. and South Africa(Africa)
*What's special, Austalia has both high life expectancy and GNP.* 

#### 5. find top life expectancy countries limited by life expectancy over 80
select * from v_continent_rank where lifeexpectancy >80 order by lifeexpectancy desc;
###### 	Finding:
	- Countries with high life expectancy above 80 years old were 1/Andorra, 2/Macao, 3/San Marino, 4/Japan, and 5/Singapore.
	- Although the United State, Germany, France, and United Kingdom were ranked among top 5 GNP growth, they didn't have high life expectacy above 80.  

#### 6. Lowest life expectancy countries below 45
select * from v_continent_rank where lifeexpectancy <=45 order by lifeexpectancy desc;
###### 	Finding:
There were 12 countries having lowest life expectancy below 45 which all locate in Africa continent. 

#### 7. is there any high life expectancy amoung African countries?
select * from v_continent_rank where continent = 'africa' and lifeexpectancy >70 order by lifeexpectancy desc;
###### 	Finding:
	- There were 6 African countries with life expectancy above 70: Saint Helena, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Tunisia, RÃ©union, Mauritius, and Seychelles. 
	- Saint Helena got the highest life expectancy with 76.8 compared to all African countries. 

#### 8. find top 5 GNP countries in Africa
select * from v_continent_rank where continent = 'africa' order by gnp desc limit 5;
###### 	Finding:
	- Top 5 GNP countries in African were South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Algeria, and Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.
	- Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was the most outstanding country in Africa for long life expectancy and high GNP growth. 

#### 9. find lowest life expectancy by continents
select code, name, continent, region,  
	lifeexpectancy, rank() over (partition by continent order by lifeexpectancy desc) as life_con_rank, rank() over (order by lifeexpectancy desc) as life_rank, min(lifeexpectancy) over (partition by continent) as lowest_con_life,
	gnp, rank() over (partition by continent order by gnp desc) as gnp_con_rank, rank() over (order by gnp desc) as gnp_rank
from country
where lifeexpectancy is not null and gnp >0 
order by continent, lifeexpectancy;
###### 	Finding:
Lowest life expectancy country by continents: 
1. Afghanistan(Asia)=45.9
2. Moldova(Europe)=64.5
3. Haiti(North American)=49.2 
4. Zambia(Africa)=37.2
5. Kiribati(Oceania)=59.8
6. Brazil(South America)=62.9
